# Back Office Handoff

Last updated: March 24, 2026

## Current Direction

Back Office is the portfolio control plane for local repo audits, dashboard aggregation, delegated task tracking, and dashboard publishing. The immediate priority is cost-safe dashboard publishing: the March 2026 AWS bill spike was traced to CloudFront invalidation charges from Back Office sync behavior, and the sync path now has both engine-level and provider-level safeguards to keep invalidation cost bounded.

## Completed

- Investigated the March 2026 AWS bill spike and confirmed it was not Lambda/runtime cost. `Amazon CloudFront` billed about `USD 1,012.35`, almost entirely from `Invalidations` on `203,470` paths.
- Confirmed the expensive path came from Back Office dashboard syncs targeting distributions `E30Z8D5XMDR1A9` (`admin.codyjo.com`) and `E372ZR95FXKVT5` (`admin.thenewbeautifulme.com`).
- Verified live invalidation batches on March 24, 2026 contained `22-23` file paths each, matching the old per-file invalidation behavior.
- Patched `backoffice/sync/engine.py` so sync invalidations collapse to one wildcard path per target:
  - root target: `/*`
  - prefixed target: `/<prefix>/*`
- Patched `backoffice/sync/providers/aws.py` so any future multi-path invalidation batch is normalized down to a single wildcard before it reaches CloudFront.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_sync_engine.py` and `tests/test_sync_providers.py`.
- Verified the sync changes with:
  - `python3 -m pytest tests/test_sync_engine.py tests/test_sync_providers.py`

## Pending

- Deploy the Back Office invalidation fix through the normal CD path before re-enabling any frequent sync/watch/overnight workflow that publishes dashboards.
- Add AWS billing guardrails at the account level for CloudFront:
  - Budget
  - Cost Anomaly Detection
- Audit whether any other repo or script bypasses the Python sync engine and submits large CloudFront invalidation path lists directly.
- Review the existing dirty worktree files before bundling Back Office changes into any future commit. This repo already contains pre-existing modified and untracked files outside this change.

## Key Decisions And Constraints

- The billing math matched exactly: CloudFront invalidation pricing is effectively `($0.005 * (paths - 1000 free))`; `203,470 - 1,000 = 202,470`, and `202,470 * 0.005 = USD 1,012.35`.
- The spike came from repeated dashboard syncs over a short window on March 24, 2026, not from normal traffic volume, Lambda usage, or origin transfer.
- Provider-level normalization is required in addition to engine-level shaping because Back Office has multiple sync invocation paths (`make dashboard`, `quick-sync`, `watch`, `overnight`, CodeBuild CD).
- Do not assume the repo is clean; there were pre-existing modified and untracked files unrelated to this fix.

## Files To Read First

- `backoffice/sync/engine.py`
- `backoffice/sync/providers/aws.py`
- `tests/test_sync_engine.py`
- `tests/test_sync_providers.py`
- `config/backoffice.yaml`
- `buildspec-cd.yml`

## Integration Points

- Dashboard target definitions: `config/backoffice.yaml`
- Dashboard publish entrypoints: `scripts/sync-dashboard.sh`, `scripts/quick-sync.sh`
- Sync caller paths:
  - `Makefile`
  - `agents/watch.sh`
  - `scripts/overnight.sh`
  - `buildspec-cd.yml`
- CloudFront targets:
  - `E30Z8D5XMDR1A9`
  - `E372ZR95FXKVT5`
  - `EF4U8A7W3OH5K` if public publish is ever enabled

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Deploy the patched Back Office sync path.
2. Verify new invalidations on the dashboard distributions use exactly one wildcard path each.
3. Add account-level CloudFront cost alarms and anomaly alerts.
4. Audit any remaining direct AWS CLI `cloudfront create-invalidation` usage for expensive path lists.

## Verification

- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_sync_engine.py tests/test_sync_providers.py`
