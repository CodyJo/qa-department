# Back Office CI/CD Reference

This is the current delivery model for Back Office and the workflow standard it scaffolds into product repos.

## Back Office Workflow Set

Back Office currently ships four workflow classes:

- `ci.yml`
- `preview.yml`
- `deploy.yml`
- `nightly-backoffice.yml`

## Back Office CI/CD Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PR[Pull request or non-main push] --> CI[ci.yml]
    PR --> PREVIEW[preview.yml]
    MAIN[Push to main] --> VALIDATE[deploy.yml :: validate]
    VALIDATE --> DEPLOY[deploy.yml :: deploy]
    SCHEDULE[Cron or manual dispatch] --> NIGHTLY[nightly-backoffice.yml]
    NIGHTLY --> CI
```

## What Each Workflow Does

### `ci.yml`

Purpose: validate Back Office changes before they reach production.

Current gates:

- shell syntax validation
- Python bytecode validation
- Ruff lint
- Back Office regression suite via `make test`

### `preview.yml`

Purpose: build a review artifact for PRs.

Current behavior:

- checks out the repo
- installs Python tooling
- generates current dashboard artifacts
- uploads the dashboard directory as a GitHub artifact

### `deploy.yml`

Purpose: publish dashboard assets to production.

Current behavior:

1. Run the same validation gates as CI.
2. Configure AWS credentials from GitHub OIDC.
3. Run `bash scripts/sync-dashboard.sh`.

That means deploys are gated by:

- shell syntax
- Python syntax
- lint
- Back Office regression tests

And production publishes now include:

- the docs hub and reference pages
- the metrics dashboard at `metrics.html`

### `nightly-backoffice.yml`

Purpose: refresh delivery metadata and nightly dashboard artifacts.

Current behavior:

1. Reuse the CI workflow.
2. Run `python3 scripts/generate-delivery-data.py`.
3. Upload nightly dashboard artifacts.

## Product Repo Standard

Back Office scaffolds four workflow types into product repos:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Back Office template] --> B[Product CI]
    A --> C[Product Preview]
    A --> D[Product CD]
    A --> E[Product Nightly]
    B --> F[Lint/Test/Build]
    C --> G[Preview artifact or staging validation]
    D --> H[Protected production deploy]
    E --> I[Nightly maintenance or release-readiness checks]
```

## Required Guardrails

Every product repo should keep these guardrails:

- CI on pull requests and non-main pushes
- preview validation before merge
- production deploy only from `main`
- smoke testing after deploy
- nightly automation for release-readiness or maintenance
- protected production environments where appropriate

## Back Office Reporting Expectations

Back Office should be able to report for each target:

- whether CI exists
- whether preview exists
- whether production deploy exists
- whether nightly exists
- whether lint/test/build are configured in `config/targets.yaml`

## Security Notes

Current production posture for Back Office dashboard publishing:

- `admin.*` domains are the intended dashboard surfaces
- public non-admin targets are skipped unless `allow_public_read: true` is explicitly set
- `deploy.yml` validates before publish
