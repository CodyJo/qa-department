# Back Office

**Autonomous multi-repo engineering operations. Privacy-first. Human-centered. Audit, prioritize, fix, build, verify, deploy — on repeat.**

Back Office is an AI-powered operating system that runs six specialized departments against your entire portfolio of codebases. It finds bugs, checks accessibility, audits compliance, evaluates SEO, identifies revenue opportunities, and builds product roadmaps — then fixes what it can, deploys what passes, and tracks what remains across cycles.

**Built on three principles:**
- **Privacy first** — user data is minimized, encrypted, and never exploited. Privacy violations are treated as bugs, not suggestions.
- **Human-centered AI** — AI augments human judgment, never replaces it. Every AI decision is transparent, explainable, and overridable.
- **Accessible by default** — every product must work for people with disabilities. Accessibility is a core value, not a compliance checkbox.

---

## Why Back Office

### Speed with safety

Software teams face a constant tension: move fast or move carefully. Back Office eliminates this tradeoff by making every autonomous change a **two-way door**:

- Every cycle starts with a **git tag snapshot** — rollback is one command
- Every fix runs in an **isolated git worktree** — main branch stays clean until tests pass
- Every feature builds on a **separate branch** — merged only after verification
- Every deploy is **gated by tests and coverage** — if quality drops, the change is discarded
- The system **gets better over time** — each cycle adds to the test suite, expanding the safety net for future changes

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Audit] --> B[Prioritize]
    B --> C[Fix / Build]
    C --> D{Tests Pass?}
    D -->|Yes| E{Coverage OK?}
    D -->|No| F[Rollback]
    E -->|Yes| G[Deploy]
    E -->|No| F
    G --> H[Report]
    H --> A
    F --> H
```

### ROI per cycle

Each overnight cycle produces measurable improvements:

| What happens | Business impact |
|---|---|
| Critical bugs fixed automatically | Fewer production incidents, less firefighting |
| Accessibility gaps closed | Reduced legal risk, broader user base |
| SEO issues resolved | Better search rankings, more organic traffic |
| Compliance gaps identified | Audit readiness, reduced regulatory exposure |
| Features implemented and tested | Faster time-to-market without developer burnout |
| Findings tracked across scans | Chronic issues surface and get prioritized — nothing falls through the cracks |

The compounding effect: as Back Office adds tests with every fix and feature, the safety net grows. Cycle 10 is safer than cycle 1 because the test coverage is higher and the backlog has more history.

### The backlog never lies

Traditional project management relies on humans remembering what was flagged. Back Office uses **content-hash deduplication** to track every finding across audits:

- First seen date, last seen date, and how many audits it appeared in
- Chronic issues (appearing in 3+ audits) get automatically prioritized
- Fixed issues stop appearing; stale issues get marked as presumed fixed
- The Product Owner agent uses this history to make smarter decisions each cycle

## How It Works

### Six departments, one command

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Departments
        QA[QA<br/>Bugs, security, performance]
        SEO[SEO<br/>Technical SEO, AI search, meta]
        ADA[ADA<br/>WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA]
        COMP[Compliance<br/>GDPR, ISO 27001, age laws]
        MON[Monetization<br/>Revenue opportunities]
        PROD[Product<br/>Feature gaps, UX, roadmap]
    end

    subgraph Targets
        R1[codyjo.com]
        R2[analogify]
        R3[portis-app]
        R4[selah]
        R5[thenewbeautifulme]
    end

    subgraph Output
        F[Structured JSON findings]
        BL[Backlog with recurrence tracking]
        D[HQ Dashboard]
        SC[Score history + trends]
    end

    R1 & R2 & R3 & R4 & R5 --> QA & SEO & ADA & COMP & MON & PROD
    QA & SEO & ADA & COMP & MON & PROD --> F
    F --> BL
    F -->|aggregate| D
    BL --> SC
```

Each department runs an AI agent with a domain-specific system prompt against a target repository. Agents write structured JSON findings to `results/<repo>/`. Those findings are aggregated, deduplicated into a persistent backlog, and served through a consolidated dashboard.

| Department | What It Audits | Trust Level |
|---|---|---|
| **QA** | Bugs, security issues, performance problems. Fix Agent auto-remediates. | Objective |
| **SEO** | Technical SEO, AI search optimization, content SEO, social meta | Objective |
| **ADA** | WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA accessibility (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) | Objective |
| **Compliance** | GDPR, ISO 27001, age verification laws (US state + UK Online Safety Act) | Objective |
| **Monetization** | Revenue opportunities: ads, affiliate, premium, print, digital, services | Advisory |
| **Product** | Feature gaps, UX improvements, technical debt, growth opportunities | Advisory |

> **Objective** findings are verifiable against standards and testable. **Advisory** findings are recommendations based on heuristics — useful but not authoritative.

## The Overnight Loop

The overnight autonomous loop is Back Office's most powerful feature. Start it before bed, wake up to a better codebase.

```mermaid

```

### How the Product Owner decides

The Product Owner is an AI agent that reads the full state of your portfolio and outputs a structured work plan:

1. **Critical/high severity fixes** with `fixable_by_agent: true` — always first
2. **Chronic issues** — findings appearing in 3+ consecutive audits
3. **Low-hanging features** — easy/moderate effort from the product roadmap
4. **Lowest-scoring repos** — target where improvement is most needed
5. **Never re-attempts** items that failed in the last 2 cycles

Maximum per cycle: **5 fixes + 2 features** (keeps cycles under 2 hours).

### Safety gates

| Gate | When | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| Git tag snapshot | Before any changes | Creates rollback point |
| Dirty worktree check | Before mutating a repo | Skips repo with warning |
| Autonomy policy | Before each fix/feature | Skips if policy disallows |
| Worktree isolation | During fixes | Discard worktree, main untouched |
| Feature branch | During builds | Branch deleted on failure |
| Test suite | After each change | Change discarded |
| Coverage check | After each change | Change discarded if coverage drops |
| Deploy policy gate | Before deploy | Skips deploy if `deploy_mode != production-allowed` |
| Failure memory | Next cycle | Doesn't re-attempt recent failures |

### Start the loop

```bash
# In tmux (recommended)
tmux new-session -d -s overnight \
  'cd /path/to/back-office && make overnight'

# With options
make overnight INTERVAL=120 TARGETS=analogify,portis-app

# Dry-run (audit + decide only, no changes)
make overnight-dry
```

### Monitor

```bash
# Watch the log
tail -f results/overnight.log

# Check current plan and history
make overnight-status

# Stop gracefully (finishes current phase)
make overnight-stop
```

### Morning review

```bash
# What happened?
make overnight-status
cat results/overnight.log | grep "CYCLE END"

# Roll back everything if needed
make overnight-rollback
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> back-office
cd back-office
make setup        # checks prerequisites, creates config
```

### 2. Configure targets

```bash
cp config/backoffice.example.yaml config/backoffice.yaml
```

Edit `config/backoffice.yaml` and add your repos:

```yaml
targets:
  my-app:
    path: /path/to/my-app
    language: typescript
    default_departments: [qa, seo, ada, compliance, monetization, product]
    lint_command: "npm run lint"
    test_command: "npm test"
    coverage_command: "npm run test:coverage"
    deploy_command: "npm run build"
    context: |
      Brief description of this project for the AI agents.
    autonomy:                          # optional — controls overnight loop behavior
      allow_fix: true                  # allow auto-fixing bugs
      allow_feature_dev: false         # allow implementing features
      allow_auto_merge: false          # allow merging feature branches
      allow_auto_deploy: false         # allow deploying to production
      deploy_mode: disabled            # disabled | manual | staging-only | production-allowed
      require_clean_worktree: true     # skip if uncommitted changes
      require_tests: true              # skip if no test suite
      max_changes_per_cycle: 3         # max fixes+features per cycle
```

### 3. Run an audit

```bash
# Single department
make qa TARGET=/path/to/my-app

# All departments (parallel)
make audit-all-parallel TARGET=/path/to/my-app

# All departments, all targets
make local-audit-all
```

### 4. View the dashboard

```bash
python -m backoffice serve --port 8070
# Open http://localhost:8070
```

The HQ dashboard shows:
- **Score cards** for each department with sparkline trends
- **Product x Department matrix** — click any cell to drill in
- **Needs Attention feed** — top findings sorted by severity and recurrence
- **Slide-over panels** — department detail, finding detail with evidence + fix suggestions

### 5. Deploy dashboards

```bash
python -m backoffice sync
```

### 6. Start the overnight loop

```bash
make overnight          # full autonomous cycle
make overnight-dry      # audit + decide only (safe preview)
```

## Per-Target Autonomy Policy

Control what the overnight loop can do to each repo:

```yaml
# In config/targets.yaml or config/backoffice.yaml
targets:
  production-app:
    path: /path/to/app
    autonomy:
      allow_fix: true              # auto-fix bugs (default: true)
      allow_feature_dev: true      # implement features (default: false)
      allow_auto_commit: true      # commit changes (default: true)
      allow_auto_merge: true       # merge feature branches (default: false)
      allow_auto_deploy: true      # deploy to production (default: false)
      deploy_mode: production-allowed  # disabled|manual|staging-only|production-allowed
      require_clean_worktree: true # skip if dirty (default: true)
      require_tests: true          # skip if no tests (default: true)
      max_changes_per_cycle: 5     # max fixes+features (default: 3)
```

When not specified, defaults are **conservative**: fixes allowed, everything else disabled. You opt in to autonomy per-repo as trust builds.

---

## Rollback

Every overnight cycle creates a git tag on each repo before making changes:

```bash
# See available snapshots
git tag | grep overnight-before

# Roll back one repo
cd /path/to/repo
git reset --hard overnight-before-20260322-230000

# Roll back all repos at once
make overnight-rollback

# Tags auto-prune after 7 days
```

---

## CI/CD

Fully automated via **AWS CodeBuild**.

| Pipeline | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `back-office-ci` | Pull request | Shell syntax, Python linting (ruff), pytest regression suite |
| `back-office-cd` | Push to `main` | Validate, test, deploy dashboards to S3/CloudFront |

Build configs: `buildspec-ci.yml` / `buildspec-cd.yml`
Infrastructure: `terraform/codebuild.tf`
Logs: CloudWatch `/codebuild/back-office`

---

## Adding a New Department

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Create prompt] --> B[Create agent script]
    B --> C[Add make target]
    C --> D[Register in audit-all]
    D --> E[Update aggregator]
    E --> F[Add to HQ dashboard panels]
```

1. Create prompt: `agents/prompts/<name>-audit.md`
2. Create script: `agents/<name>-audit.sh` (follow existing pattern)
3. Add make target to `Makefile`
4. Register in `audit-all` / `audit-all-parallel` sequences
5. Add to `backoffice/aggregate.py` department list
6. Add panel template to `dashboard/index.html`
7. Add standards reference: `lib/<name>-standards.md`

---

## Governance

See `MASTER-PROMPT.md` for the full autonomy safety framework, engineering standards, and operating priorities that govern all Back Office development and autonomous operations.

Key principles:
- Autonomy is only good when observable, constrained, reversible, testable, and explainable
- Protect production first — a skipped deploy is better than a bad deploy
- Distinguish objective findings (verifiable) from advisory recommendations (heuristic)
- Fail closed on invalid data — never trust agent output without validation
- Every autonomous write preserves rollback capability
