# Back Office

**A multi-department operating system of AI agents that audit, scan, and fix codebases.**

Back Office by the Cody Jo Method gives you six specialized departments -- QA, SEO, ADA Compliance, Regulatory Compliance, Monetization Strategy, and Product Roadmap -- each staffed by AI agents that produce structured findings, severity-scored and tracked through a task queue. Results feed into per-department dashboards deployed to S3/CloudFront, giving you a single pane of glass across your entire portfolio.

## How It Works

Each department runs an AI agent with a domain-specific system prompt against a target repository. Agents write structured JSON findings to `results/<repo>/`. Those findings are aggregated into dashboard data payloads, synced to S3, and served through CloudFront.

| Department | Agent | What It Audits |
|---|---|---|
| **QA** | QA Agent + Fix Agent | Bugs, security issues, performance problems. Fix Agent auto-remediates. |
| **SEO** | SEO Agent | Technical SEO, AI search optimization, content SEO, social meta |
| **ADA** | ADA Agent | WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA accessibility (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) |
| **Compliance** | Compliance Agent | GDPR, ISO 27001, age verification laws (US state + UK Online Safety Act) |
| **Monetization** | Monetization Agent | Revenue opportunities: ads, affiliate, premium, print, digital, services, sponsorships |
| **Product** | Product Agent | Feature gaps, UX improvements, technical debt, growth opportunities, prioritized roadmap |

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> back-office
cd back-office
python -m backoffice setup          # interactive wizard -- checks prerequisites, configures runner
```

### 2. Configure targets

```bash
cp config/backoffice.example.yaml config/backoffice.yaml
# Edit config/backoffice.yaml -- add your repos under the targets: section

### 4. View the dashboard locally

```bash
python -m backoffice serve --port 8070
# Open http://localhost:8070
```

### 5. Deploy dashboards to S3/CloudFront

```bash
python -m backoffice sync
```

### Make Target Equivalents

For workflows that combine shell agent scripts with the Python CLI, `make` targets remain the primary interface:

| Make Target | Equivalent / What It Does |

| `make cli CMD="..."` | `python -m backoffice ...` |
| `make clean` | Remove all `results/` and dashboard data JSON files |

## Dashboards

Each department has a static HTML dashboard that reads from a `<department>-data.json` file. The full set:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dashboard/index.html` | Company HQ -- portfolio overview, links to all departments |
| `dashboard/qa.html` | QA findings, severity breakdown, fix status |
| `dashboard/seo.html` | SEO audit results and scores |
| `dashboard/ada.html` | ADA/WCAG compliance findings |
| `dashboard/compliance.html` | Regulatory compliance status |
| `dashboard/monetization.html` | Revenue opportunity analysis |
| `dashboard/product.html` | Product roadmap and backlog |
| `dashboard/jobs.html` | Real-time job progress during scans |
| `dashboard/backoffice.html` | Public-facing bug report form |

### Deployment pattern

1. Agents write findings to `results/<repo>/<department>-findings.json`
2. `python -m backoffice refresh` aggregates results into `dashboard/*-data.json`
3. `python -m backoffice sync` uploads HTML + JSON to S3 buckets configured in `config/backoffice.yaml`
4. CloudFront serves them at `backoffice.yourdomain.com`

You can configure multiple `dashboard_targets` in the config to deploy filtered views to different subdomains (e.g., one dashboard per client site).

## Configuration

All configuration lives in a single file: `config/backoffice.yaml` (gitignored -- never commit this file, it contains paths and secrets). Copy the example to get started:

```bash
cp config/backoffice.example.yaml config/backoffice.yaml
```

### runner

Defines which AI coding agent to invoke and how to parse its output.

```yaml
runner:
  command: "claude --model haiku"
  mode: "claude-print"           # claude-print | claude-json | custom
```

### api

Configuration for the local and production API servers.

```yaml
api:
  port: 8070
  api_key: ""                    # leave empty to disable auth
  allowed_origins:
    - "https://backoffice.yourdomain.com"
    - "http://localhost:8070"
```

### deploy

Where dashboards are published. Supports multiple S3 buckets with per-target repo filtering.

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: aws
  aws:
    region: us-east-1
    dashboard_targets:
      - bucket: "admin-yoursite-bucket"
        distribution_id: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        subdomain: "backoffice.yourdomain.com"
        filter_repo: "yoursite"       # null = show all repos
        allow_public_read: false
```

### scan

Controls what the agents check and how many findings to collect.

```yaml
scan:
  run_linter: true
  run_tests: true
  security_audit: true
  performance_review: true
  code_quality: true
  min_severity: low
  max_findings: 200
  exclude_patterns:
    - "node_modules/**"
    - "venv/**"
```

### fix

Auto-fix behavior for the Fix Agent.

```yaml
fix:
  auto_fix_severity: high
  run_tests_after_fix: true
  max_parallel_fixes: 4
  auto_commit: true
  auto_push: false
```

### targets

Each key is a repo name used in CLI commands, dashboard filters, and results paths.

```yaml
targets:
  my-project:
    path: /path/to/my-project
    language: python
    default_departments: [qa, seo, ada, compliance, monetization, product]
    lint_command: "ruff check ."
    test_command: "python3 -m pytest"
    coverage_command: "python3 -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=json:coverage.json"
    deploy_command: "bash scripts/deploy.sh"
    context: |

## Adding a New Site

To onboard a new repository into the Back Office audit pipeline:

1. **Add a target entry** in `config/backoffice.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    targets:
      new-site:
        path: /path/to/new-site
        language: typescript
        default_departments: [qa, seo, ada, compliance, monetization, product]
        lint_command: "npm run lint"
        test_command: "npm test"
        coverage_command: "npm run test:coverage"
        deploy_command: "npm run build"
        context: |
          Description of the site for agents.
    ```

2. **Verify the target is visible**:

    ```bash
    python -m backoffice list-targets
    ```

3. **Run a single-department test audit**:

    ```bash
    python -m backoffice audit new-site --departments qa
    ```

4. **Run the full audit**:

    ```bash
    python -m backoffice audit new-site
    ```

5. **Refresh and deploy dashboards**:

    ```bash
    python -m backoffice refresh
    python -m backoffice sync
    ```

6. **(Optional) Scaffold CI workflows** into the target repo:

    ```bash
    python -m backoffice scaffold --target new-site --workflows ci,preview,cd,nightly
    ```

## Adding a New Department

To add a new audit department to the Back Office:

1. **Create the agent prompt** at `agents/prompts/<name>-audit.md`. Define the audit scope, output format, and severity rubric. Follow the pattern of existing prompts.

2. **Create the agent script** at `agents/<name>-audit.sh`. Copy an existing audit script (e.g., `agents/seo-audit.sh`) and update the prompt path and department name.

3. **Create the dashboard** at `dashboard/<name>.html`. Build from an existing department dashboard template. The page should read from `<name>-data.json`.

4. **Add standards references** at `lib/<name>-standards.md` with the domain knowledge the agent needs.

5. **Add a make target** to the `Makefile`:

    ```makefile
    <name>: ## Run <name> audit on TARGET repo
    	@test -n "$(TARGET)" || (echo "Usage: make <name> TARGET=/path/to/repo" && exit 1)
    	bash agents/<name>-audit.sh "$(TARGET)"
    ```

6. **Register the department** in the audit-all sequences in the `Makefile` (both sequential and parallel variants).

7. **Update the HQ dashboard** in `dashboard/index.html` to include a card for the new department.

8. **Update aggregation** so that `backoffice/aggregate.py` picks up the new department's findings pattern.
